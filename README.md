# Readvox

Readvox is a local-first, mobile-friendly web app for turning long text, article URLs, and reviewed OCR drafts into streamed text-to-speech audio. It is designed for personal use on a trusted machine: run it on localhost, optionally expose it through a private HTTPS proxy, and keep the generated audio, source text, OCR images, and playback progress in local storage.

The app focuses on long-form reading. It generates audio incrementally so playback can begin before the whole article is complete, then stitches completed segment audio into a continuous playback stream so mobile browsers do not have to switch audio files while the page is in the background.

## Features

- Generate speech from pasted text.
- Fetch and extract simple HTML article URLs.
- Upload or capture page images, review OCR output, then generate audio from the reviewed text.
- Choose named, saved voice profiles with voice, speed, model, instructions, and cached previews.
- Edit profiles in-app or at `/voice-sample`; preview unsaved changes and save without losing input drafts.
- Play long articles through one continuous audio endpoint backed by incrementally stitched MP3 segments.
- Track segment-based progress and keep the currently read text highlighted during continuous playback.
- Resume and delete History entries, including cached audio and linked OCR source images.
- Store playback telemetry locally in SQLite for debugging mobile/background playback failures.
- Run with deterministic fake providers for tests and local UI checks, or Qwen providers for real TTS/OCR.

## How It Works

    UI[Mobile web UI] --> API[FastAPI app]
    API --> Store[(SQLite metadata)]

    Stitcher --> Full[full.mp3 artifact]

    UI -->|/continuous-audio?start_segment=N| Playback[Continuous playback route]
    Playback --> Full
    Playback --> Store
```

The database owns metadata and relationships. The filesystem owns bytes:

- SQLite: generations, text segments, audio segment metadata, continuous audio artifact metadata, OCR drafts/images, voice preferences, named voice profiles, and playback telemetry.
- `data/audio/<generation_id>/`: generated segment MP3s plus `full.mp3`.
- `data/images/<ocr_draft_id>/`: stored source images for OCR drafts.

For the exact current database shape, see [docs/schema.sql](docs/schema.sql). For relationship notes and cleanup semantics, see [docs/data-model.md](docs/data-model.md). For module boundaries and future development guidance, see [docs/architecture.md](docs/architecture.md).

## Quick Start

```bash
python -m venv .venv
. .venv/bin/activate
pip install -e ".[dev]"
TTS_PROVIDER=fake .venv/bin/uvicorn tts_app.api:create_app --factory --host 127.0.0.1 --port 8001
```

Open `http://127.0.0.1:8001`.

Use the fake provider for development and tests. It writes deterministic audio-like files and does not call external services.

## Real Providers

Readvox currently supports Qwen realtime TTS and Qwen OCR through provider adapters.

```bash
TTS_PROVIDER=qwen
OCR_PROVIDER=qwen
DASHSCOPE_API_KEY=...
TTS_MODEL=qwen3-tts-instruct-flash-realtime
OCR_MODEL=qwen-vl-ocr
QWEN_REALTIME_URL=wss://dashscope-intl.aliyuncs.com/api-ws/v1/realtime
TTS_DEFAULT_ENGLISH_VOICE=Kai
TTS_DEFAULT_CHINESE_VOICE=Cherry
```

Provider setup, pricing notes, and environment variables live in [docs/configuration.md](docs/configuration.md).

## Local Development

Run with reload while editing:

```bash
TTS_PROVIDER=fake .venv/bin/uvicorn tts_app.api:create_app \
  --factory \
  --reload \
  --reload-dir src \
  --host 127.0.0.1 \
  --port 8001 \
  --log-level info
```

Run checks before claiming work is complete:

```bash
.venv/bin/pytest -q
npm run check:js
npm run lint:js
npm run test:js
```

## Deployment And Operations

The intended deployment is still local-first:

- Bind Readvox to `127.0.0.1:8001`.
- Put a private HTTPS proxy in front only for trusted devices.
- Do not expose the app publicly; URL generation lets users ask the host to fetch arbitrary reachable HTTP(S) URLs.

Systemd deployment files live under `setup/`, and the deployment runbook is [docs/deployment.md](docs/deployment.md). Logging and manual verification notes are in [docs/operations.md](docs/operations.md).
